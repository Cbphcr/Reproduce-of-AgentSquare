    "thought": "Given the performance metrics of the discovered planning modules, it's evident that there's a need for a more dynamic and adaptive approach to task decomposition and planning. The existing modules either focus too narrowly on the task at hand without considering potential obstacles or fail to effectively utilize feedback for iterative improvement. A novel approach could involve integrating a dynamic feedback mechanism that not only decomposes tasks into subtasks but also evaluates the feasibility of each subtask in real-time, adjusting the plan based on the environment's current state and previous actions' outcomes. This would involve a two-phase planning process: initial decomposition followed by continuous refinement based on environmental feedback and intermediate results. Such an approach could significantly enhance the agent's ability to navigate the complex and unpredictable environments of ALFworld by making the planning process more resilient to changes and unexpected obstacles.",
