    "thought": "Given the performance metrics and the nature of the ALFworld tasks, which require sequential decision-making and interaction with a simulated environment, the next interesting agent to try should focus on leveraging a combination of hierarchical task decomposition and environmental awareness with an emphasis on dynamic adaptation. This approach would involve not only breaking down the task into sub-tasks that consider spatial and functional relationships but also dynamically adjusting the plan based on real-time feedback from the environment. The planning module should incorporate a mechanism for evaluating the feasibility of each sub-task in the current state of the environment and suggest alternatives if a sub-task becomes unfeasible. This method aims to improve the completion rate by ensuring that the plan remains viable throughout the execution, adapting to changes and unexpected obstacles in the environment.",
